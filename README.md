# About me

Writes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Still using jQuery / Vanila for JS and Vanila PHP.

Knows some React.js but don't like it lol, always feel good for being classic :)

Don't use Laravel. ~~(Too java)~~

I do have written something but none of them is good :) Currently working on my own WordPress theme, will release it soon :D

Also knows Apple's language Swift, but I have never written anything useful.

Here's [My Website](https://frank419.link), don't guarantee will always keep working on it, or renew the domain :P
